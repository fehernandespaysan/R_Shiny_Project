# R_Shiny_Project

Data Product created as a final project for the course 'Data Product' at Coursera.

The goal is to create a data project using R Shiny application. 

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards ([more info](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)). 

***Documents available***:

**Data Product Final Project (presentation).Rmd** - presentation created to present the project. Here you can find all the steps performed and links to the presentation and app.

**Data_Product_Final_Project__presentation_.html** - HTML version of the presentation

**myapp folder** - here you can find the the 'server.R' and 'ui.R' documents used to create the app.
